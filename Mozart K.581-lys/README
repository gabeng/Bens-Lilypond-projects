This is a reproduction of the Breitkopf & Haertel score of Mozart's
Quintet for Clarinet and Strings KV. 581.

The provided makefile will create the score as well as the solo parts;
type "make help" to get a list of possible targets.


EDITORIAL NOTES

The B&H edition I typeset is the so-called "Alte Mozart Ausgabe", made in the
1870-1880s by an unknown editor (my 1978 Dover reprint does not tell who he
was). The autograph of this quintet is lost, but my edition lacks any
editorial note which states what was the source text. If you are interested in
a modern and carefully checked edition of this quintet, search for the Neue
Mozart Ausgabe or the Barenreiter Score (the latter is based on the former,
but seems to be a little cheaper). You can find it online at
http://dme.mozarteum.at (search for the NMA online, VIII/19/Abt. 2, pp. 15-38).

As already said, the autograph is lost; it is therefore difficult to determine
what was the original score. In my opinion, some dynamics seem to be arbitrary
additions: for instance, this is the only Breitkopf & Haertel score of Mozart
chamber music which uses < and > signs to indicate crescendi and decrescendi
(usually they use "cresc." and "decresc." only). These signs are often used in
a "romantic" way which is not the well-known Mozart style (e.g. mvt. II, bars
30 and 32, clarinet part). I suspect them to have been added by the unknown
XIX-century editor.
